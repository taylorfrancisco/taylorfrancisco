### Hello, my name is Taylor Francisco! <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/MartinHeinz/MartinHeinz/master/wave.gif" width="30px">


I am an Indigenous scientist committed to addressing systemic disparities through the intersection of data analysis and public policy. Fueled by a passion for healing trauma, my mission is to leverage my expertise in data science, neuroscience research, and advocacy to drive positive societal change and enhance the well-being of marginalized populations by tackling both structural and legal determinants of health outcomes.

I earned my Bachelor’s degree in Neuroscience and Behavior from Columbia University in Spring 2021, followed by a Master’s degree in Quantitative Methods in the Social Sciences in Spring 2024. My thesis, titled "Representing the Asterisk Nation: A Bayesian Approach to Model Trends in Small Populations," investigated the application of Bayesian Inference as a solution to the systematic exclusion of Native Americans in statistical analyses.

As a woman of color in STEM, I am dedicated to creating opportunities for other underrepresented youth in academia as well as being a champion for systemic diversity and equity. 

When I am not researching you can find me walking throughout the city trying all the vegan restaurants 🍜 or squirrel watching in Central Park 🐿️.
